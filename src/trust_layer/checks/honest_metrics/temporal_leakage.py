"""Auditor signature check: temporal leakage in a train/test split.

The #1 way a backtest lies: rows from AFTER the cutoff leak into training (or the split
is random instead of time-ordered), so the model 'sees the future'. A dashboard then
shows +40% ROI that evaporates live.

This check takes the timestamps assigned to train vs test and detects:
  - overlap: test rows dated at/after cutoff that also appear in train,
  - order violation: train rows dated AFTER test rows (random-split fingerprint).

Pure function over timestamps; no DataHub dependency.
