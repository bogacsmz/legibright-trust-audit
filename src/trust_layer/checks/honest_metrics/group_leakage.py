"""Auditor check: group leakage — the same entity in both train and test.

A temporal split can still leak if the same entity (customer, team, horse, user) appears in
both train and test: the model memorizes the entity, not the pattern, and the holdout is
contaminated. This check takes the group/entity ids of the train and test rows and flags
overlap. Independent of timestamps and of the split SQL.
